##  Good morning! ğŸ‘‹
ğŸŒ± I am currently interested in embedded devices (ESP32/8266, micro:bit), (micro)Python and DeepLearning.  
I have a background as software engineer (mostly C++ and Qt) backed by a degree in computerscience.  
Learning out of curiosity and habit. Standing on the shoulders of giants.
